#SieveofEratosthenes
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes’ method:
    Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, …, n).
    Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
    Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
    Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
#Input: an integer n > 1.

 Let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
 initially all set to true.

 for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding √n:
   if A[i] is true:
     for j = i^2, i^2+i, i^2+2i, i^2+3i, ..., not exceeding n:
       A[j] := false.

#Output: all i such that A[i] is true.
#Example
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to 30, proceed as follows.
First, generate a list of integers from 2 to 30:
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
The first number in the list is 2; cross out every 2nd number in the list after 2 by counting up from 2 in increments of 2 (these will be all the multiples of 2 in the list):
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
The next number in the list after 2 is 3; cross out every 3rd number in the list after 3 by counting up from 3 in increments of 3 (these will be all the multiples of 3 in the list):
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 3 is 5; cross out every 5th number in the list after 5 by counting up from 5 in increments of 5 (i.e. all the multiples of 5):
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 5 is 7; the next step would be to cross out every 7th number in the list after 7, but they are all already crossed out at this point, as these numbers (14, 21, 28) are also multiples of smaller primes because 7 × 7 is greater than 30. The numbers not crossed out at this point in the list are all the prime numbers below 30:
 2  3     5     7           11    13          17    19          23                29
